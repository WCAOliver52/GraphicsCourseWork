## Coursework Submission for the Course F21GA

### Introduction

This Git repository contains the work completed by William Oliver (H00288939, wco1).
The objective for the coursework of F21GA is to complete a diorama of any subject. 
This diorama was split into three tasks: 

- Modelling and Rendering the Diorama in Autodesk Maya.

- Importing the created models into Unreal 4 Engine to then create an Animation.

- Importing the model object files into OpenGL and manipulating them to create an interactive application.

These tasks can be viewed in this repository, in their respective directories. 
The appendices directory contains extra renders/snapshots during the process of development to help further explain concepts discussed in this repository.

### Diorama Concept

The theme and concept of the developed diorama is a Greek Temple on a floating island. The concept was inspired by the idea of Gods in the sky, especially Greek Gods of Olympus. The diorama consists of a floating island with a path leading to a Greek Temple, surrounded by trees and rocks. Barrels and ancient weapons of swords and shields show signs of civilisation within the forest. While outlining the path to the temple with fences further seperates the civilised from the wild.
